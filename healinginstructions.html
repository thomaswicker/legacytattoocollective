            Once tattoo is healed, use high SPF sunblock when exposed to direct sunlight. Try to avoid exposing your tattoo to direct sunlight for long periods of time.

            <div class="divider-line"></div>
          </li>
          
          <li class="healing-instruction">
            DO NOT expose healing tattoo to direct sun, swimming or public water, hot tub, unclean conditions, irritating clothing, or anything else that may hinder healing.

            <div class="divider-line flip"></div>
          </li>
          
          <li class="healing-instruction">
            Do not pick or scratch any scabbing, allow it to come off on its own. Scabbing usually flakes off in 7-10 days. Keep clean and continue to use A&D or fragrance-free lotion until healed. Wear clean, loose clothing to protect tattoo while healing.

            <div class="divider-line"></div>
          </li>
          
          <li class="healing-instruction">
            Wash tattoo twice daily while healing and use a thin layer of A&D ointment or Aquaphor as needed to prevent dryness. It is fine to wash in the shower or tub, but do no allow the area to soak.

            <div class="divider-line flip"></div>
          </li>
          
          <li class="healing-instruction">
            Remove bandage within a few hours and wash with warm water and soap. Pat dry with a clean paper towel and apply a thin layer of A&D or similar. Remove any excess with a clean, dry paper towel.
